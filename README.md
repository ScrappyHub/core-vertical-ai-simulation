# CORE VERTICAL — AI & Simulation

This repository defines AI and simulation-facing interpretation layers for CORE.

It focuses on producing validated datasets derived from physics truth.

## Scope
- Physics-derived training datasets
- Validation harnesses
- Synthetic scenario generation (truth-bound)
- Confidence scoring surfaces

## Non-Scope
- No model training pipelines
- No autonomous decision systems
- No physics engines
- No governance authority

## Architecture Position
Consumes outputs from all CORE engines via SIGNAL and RGSR.

## Governance
All data must remain traceable, reproducible, and non-hallucinatory.
